Data Modelling:
I Inspected the CSVs and created an ERD of the tables through QuickDBD. An image of this can be found in the above "Images" folder.

Data Engineering:
Using the ERD, I created tables for each of the CSV files and imported the data for each. 

Data Analysis:
Finally, once the database was completed, a series of SQL commands were used to find specific pieces of information based on a series of requirements. The code for this can be found in the folder labelled "EmployeeSQL".
